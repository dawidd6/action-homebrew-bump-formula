# Homebrew bump formula GitHub Action

An action that wraps `brew bump-formula-pr` to ease the process of updating the formula on new project releases.

Works on Ubuntu and macOS runners.

## Usage

One should use the [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo,workflow) for `token` input to this Action, not the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, because `brew bump-formula-pr` creates a fork of the formula's tap repository (if needed) and then creates a pull request.

> There are two ways to use this Action.

### Standard mode

Use if you want to simply bump the formula, when a new release happens.

Listen for new tags in workflow:

```yaml
on:
  # trigger when release got created (preferred)
  release:
    types: [released]
  # trigger on tag push
  # push:
  #   tags:
  #     - "*"
```

The Action will extract all needed informations by itself, you just need to specify the following step in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Update Homebrew formula
  uses: dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula@v5
  with:
    # Required, custom GitHub access token with the 'public_repo' and 'workflow' scopes
    token: ${{secrets.TOKEN}}
    # Optional, will commit with this user name
    user_name: name
    # Optional, will commit with this user email
    user_email: email@example.com
    # Optional, will create tap repo fork in organization
    org: ORG
    # Optional, use the origin repository instead of forking
    no_fork: false
    # Optional, defaults to homebrew/core
    tap: USER/REPO
    # Formula name, required
    formula: FORMULA
    # Optional, will be determined automatically
    tag: ${{github.ref}}
    # Optional, will be determined automatically
    revision: ${{github.sha}}
    # Optional, if don't want to check for already open PRs
    force: false # true
```

### Livecheck mode

If `livecheck` input is set to `true`, the Action will run `brew livecheck` to check if any provided formulae are outdated or if tap contains any outdated formulae and then will run `brew bump-formula-pr` on each of those formulae with proper arguments to bump them.

Might be a good idea to run this on schedule in your tap repo, so one gets automated PRs updating outdated formulae.

If there are no outdated formulae, the Action will just exit.

```yaml
- name: Update Homebrew formula
  uses: dawidd6/action-homebrew-bump-formula@v4
  with:
    # Required, custom personal GitHub access token with only the 'public_repo' scope enabled
    token: ${{secrets.CUSTOM_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}}
    # Optional, will commit with this user name
    user_name: user_name
    # Optional, will commit with this user email
    user_email: email@example.com
    # Optional, will create tap repo fork in organization
    org: ORG
    # Bump all outdated formulae in this tap
    tap: USER/REPO
    # Bump only these formulae if outdated
    formula: FORMULA-1, FORMULA-2, FORMULA-3, ...
    # Optional, if don't want to check for already open PRs
    force: false # true
    # Need to set this input if want to use `brew livecheck`
    livecheck: true
```

If only `tap` input is provided, all formulae in given tap will be checked and bumped if needed.
